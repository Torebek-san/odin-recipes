        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>grits</li>
            <li>onions</li>
            <li>shrimps</li>
            <li>bell pepper</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>chicken stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the grits are cooking, finely chop onion, bell peppers, and garlic to prep for the gravy. Next, cook a few pieces of bacon until crisp and remove them from the pan for later use. Add a pound of chopped andouille sausage and cook until the color is a deep brown.</li>
            <li>Set the sausage aside before quickly sauteing the shrimp in the remaining fat — the goal here is to add color without fully cooking, as the shrimp will finish in the gravy. Set them aside, add a splash of bacon grease to the pan, and saute the garlic vegetable medley until the onions are translucent.</li>
            <li>Whisk in flour, butter, and chicken stock before adding the andouille sausage. Allow the gravy to simmer for 4-5 minutes, then stir in shrimp and fresh parsley. Now's the time for customization — add Cheddar to the grits for an even creamier bite or hot sauce to your gravy for a mouthwatering kick. Spoon the shrimp and gravy over the grits and enjoy the rich flavors of this timeless Southern delicacy.</li>
